      <p>Pig dice game is played with a single six-sided die and players are allowed to make any number of rolls in each turn.</p>
      <p>After each roll the dice value is added to their score for that turn.</p>
      <p>After each roll player can decide whether to stop rolling and claim the total turn score or continue rolling.</p>
      <p>If they roll a 1 then they lose all points scored in a particular turn and turn is then passed to the opponent.</p>
      <p>This has no impact on their overall score.</p>
      <p>If players decide to stop rolling, they get the points scored so far which is added to their overall score.</p>
      <p>The first player to score 100 points wins the game.</p>

      <ol>
      <li><p>The first player rolls the die. If he rolls as 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, he writes down the score.</p></li>
      <li><p>If he did not roll a 1, the player can decide to roll again. If he again rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, he adds that number to his previous score. If he rolls a 1, he earns no score and immediately passes the die to the next player.</p></li>
      <li><p>When a player doesnâ€™t roll a 1, he can decide to continue rolling and adding the points from each roll to his total score for that turn. Or he can hold onto his points and pass the die to the next player.</p></li>
      <li><p>However!,if the player rolls a 1, he loses all his points and must pass the die to the next player.</p></li>
      <li><p>Play continues in this manner until one player reaches a score of 100.</p></li>
